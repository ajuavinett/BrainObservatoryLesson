# BrainObservatoryLesson
Code &amp; documentation for a lesson plan working through Allen Institute Brain Observatory data.

## Learning objectives:
1. Devise a hypothesis about cell types in visual perception
2. Analyze two-photon imaging data to test this hypothesis
3. Plot summaries of two-photon data that address your hypothesis


## Step 1. Familiarize yourself with the dataset
In this lesson, you’ll be looking at neural responses to two different types of stimuli: drifting gratings & natural scenes. It’ll help to get an idea of what you’re looking at, before you dive into the data.

1. Go to The Allen Brain Observatory homepage. This page will bring up a view of mouse visual cortex, as if you were looking down at it. You’ll see VISp (primary visual cortex) in the middle, surrounded by secondary visual areas.
2. All of the possible cre-driver lines are on the side — choose one of these to look at today. Take a look at these descriptions of the transgenic mouse lines for more information. You’ll need this information for Question 1 on the assignment.
3. Scroll down to “Learn About Visual Stimuli” and click on Drifting Gratings.
4. Read through the page and check out some of the interactive elements to get a sense for what the drifting gratings stimuli actually looking like.
5. Go back and take a look at the Natural Scenes page as well. Does your cell type prefer a certain scene?

## Step 2. Analyze the data through the Allen SDK
1. Go to http://datahub.ucsd.edu and log in.
2. You’ll land on a page where you’re asked to choose a container to spawn. Choose the one that says BIPN 145.
3. On the Jupyter home page, go to New > Terminal (upper right corner).
4. Type `git clone http://www.github.com/ajuavinett/BrainObservatoryLesson.git`
5. Open up the BrainObservatoryLesson notebook and get started!

<u>Note</u>: When you’re done, be sure to close any notebooks or terminals that are still running (go to the Running tab on the Jupyter Notebook dashboard).
